# Coil-Frequency-Simulator
Precursor to an automated test bench for testing coils and inductors
This program inputs several low level values of a coil and perferms a frequency sweep
It then finds the resonant frequency of the coil and what the theoretical magnetic field strength should be 

I held the profile of the coil into an object and it will allow me to do paralel testing of several coils and sweep through several parameters at the same time
next I will add the data visualization script I have something special comming for that 
And then the microcontroller state machine that will interface with the script 
Lastly I will package everything into an application and deploy it
